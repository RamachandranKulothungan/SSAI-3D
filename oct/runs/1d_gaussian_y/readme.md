Test with 1d gaussian filter along y direction(horizontal)
Denoising done using projection of 4 layers

1. deblurring by increasing resolution in z direction with xz images
2. debluriing by increasing resolution in y direction with xy images of deblurred xz image stack

Results:
1. More enhanced texture changes probably due to the speckle noise
